The Disappearance Of Crispina Umberleigh
In a first-class carriage of a train speeding Balkanward across
the flat, green Hungarian plain two Britons sat in friendly, fitful
converse. They had first foregathered in the cold grey dawn at the
frontier line, where the presiding eagle takes on an extra head and
Teuton lands pass from Hohenzollern to Habsburg keeping -- and where
a probing official beak requires to delve in polite and perhaps
perfunctory, but always tiresome, manner into the baggage of
sleephungry passengers. After a day's break of their journey at Vienna
the travellers had again foregathered at the trainside and paid one
another the compliment of settling instinctively into the same carriage.
The elder of the two had the appearance and manner of a diplomat; in
point of fact he was the well-connected foster-brother of a wine
business. The other was certainly a journalist. Neither man was
talkative and each was grateful to the other for not being talkative.
That is why from time to time they talked.
